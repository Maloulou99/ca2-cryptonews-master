The market updates page should display the current market
price of at least 1 cryptocurrency. You can use placeholder
text or real data from external APIs to populate these section
(cryptocurrency name and price).

If the user is not logged in, this page should display a
generic welcome message, specifically "Welcome to CryptoNews!
Login if you want to see your updated data.". Otherwise,
the page title should be "Market Updates" and the page content should be
the user's crypto balance (introduced in the user registration form) and,
as said before, the current market price of at least 1 cryptocurrency.
Feel free to customize the page as you want.
